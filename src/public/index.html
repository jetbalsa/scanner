                <h3>The Digital Echo</h3>
                <p>Every action we take online leaves a persistent digital trace. With over 900,000 tracking servers monitoring our activities, our digital footprint is vastly larger than most people realize. These traces form an intricate web of data points that paint a detailed picture of our online behaviors, preferences, and patterns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>The Data Trade</h3>
                <p>Personal data has become a valuable commodity in today's digital economy, but it's fundamentally different from other traded goods because it represents our basic human right to privacy. Companies continuously collect, analyze, and trade our information through complex networks of data brokers and advertisers, often without our meaningful consent or knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
                <p>The advertising technology ecosystem operates through a sophisticated network of real-time tracking and bidding systems. When you visit a website, your personal data is instantly uploaded and shared with hundreds of companies who bid for the opportunity to show you ads. This happens in milliseconds, with your information being traded in ways that are largely invisible to you. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>The True Cost</h3>
                <p>While many digital services appear to be 'free,' we actually pay with our personal information. This systematic data collection affects more than just privacy - it can influence our choices, shape our opinions, and even impact our access to opportunities. The real cost is the loss of control over our personal information and how it's used.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Your Digital Rights</h3>
                <p>Privacy is recognized as a fundamental human right, and modern data protection laws require that consent for data collection should be freely given and informed. You have the right to know what data companies hold about you and request its deletion, though exercising these rights can be deliberately made difficult by companies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Industry Impact</h3>
                <p>The AdTech industry requires significant reform to better protect user privacy. While privacy-respecting alternatives exist, the current system prioritizes data collection over user rights. Real change will only come through increased user awareness and stronger enforcement of privacy regulations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Network Architecture</h3>
                <p>The system runs on a single host acting as a Wi-Fi access point using hostapd, creating an isolated network environment. When users connect, they're routed through NAT (Network Address Translation), allowing the system to monitor all traffic passing through. The setup provides a controlled space where all user traffic can be analyzed without affecting their regular browsing habits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Detection System</h3>
                <p>Once a user's device connects and begins browsing, the system monitors all outbound connections. Any traffic destined for IP addresses matching known ad broker servers is captured and represented in the visualization. This creates a real-time feed showing how user activity generates connections to tracking servers, represented as "hungry triangles" consuming data in the visual interface. The system effectively demonstrates the constant stream of personal data being sent to advertising networks during normal browsing activity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Protecting Your Digital Self</h3>
                <p>Take control of your online privacy with these effective steps. Use a privacy-focused browser with extensions that block trackers and ads. Consider using browser containers to isolate your online activities, preventing cross-site tracking. Enable Do Not Track settings in your browsers and apps, and regularly clear your cookies and browsing data. For additional protection, consider using a VPN and opt for privacy-respecting services that don't rely on data collection for revenue. Remember, the most effective protection is being mindful of what information you share online in the first place.</p>
